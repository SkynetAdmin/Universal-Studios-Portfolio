; Hardware: Arduino Mega 2560 + RAMPS 1.4

M117 "Initializing Horror Sequence..."
G28 ; Home all positions (head, arms, jaw)

; Witch Activation Sequence
G1 X50 F1500 ; Turn head left (creepy slow movement)
M106 S255 ; Activate LED eyes (full brightness)
G4 P2000 ; Wait 2 seconds for dramatic effect

; Scream Sequence
G1 Y20 F3000 ; Open jaw quickly
M300 S440 P1000 ; Play scream sound (A4 note)
G1 Y0 F500 ; Close jaw slowly

; Horror Dance Movement
G1 X0 Y0 Z10 F2000 ; Multi-axis coordinated movement
G1 X-30 Y5 Z0 F1000 ; Arm swing with head tilt
